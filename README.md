# About rcsi
R package to handle Campbell Scientific (R) data files formats

# Install
Currently, rcsi is not available on CRAN. I'll submit it as soon as it'll comply with their packages rules.
Waiting the moment where you will be able to do `install.packages("rcsi")`, you can install it with

    devtools::install_github("Rupicapra-rupicapra/rcsi")

Installation should be done in less than a minute.
